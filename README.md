# 42 pipex tester
This is a tester for the project `pipex` from the ecole 42 core curriculum. It is designed to facilitate the addition of your own custom test cases.

> This tester is written **for linux**. There might be issues if you use a different OS :exclamation:

> If the tester helps you, leave a star on github to make it more visible for others :star:

> If you find a bug, send me a message on slack please (@mmoser) :email:

## Usage
### Download
Clone the repository **into your pipex directory**:
```
git clone https://github.com/michmos/42_pipex_tester.git && cd 42_pipex_tester
```
Alternatively, you can clone it elsewhere and adjust the relative path inside `run.sh`.

Ensure you have a Makefile in place and that your program compiles to `pipex` (also the bonus, in case you did it).

### Run
```
bash run.sh
```
By default, the tester displays information for each test case that fails. You can disable this optionally:
```
bash run.sh --hide-errors
```

## Layout

The tester compares your program with the original shell piping in terms of:
* **output** to the specified file
* **exit status**
* **time** - differences here may indicate that your parent is not waiting for all children to terminate
* **leaks** in the parent


## Adapt
Test cases can easily be added to  `run.sh`  following the same structure as the existing ones.
Two variables are available for customization:
* `LEAKS_ONLY`: if set to 1, all subsequent test cases will only be checked for leaks and fatal errors, until it is reset to 0
* `HERE_DOC`: a string used as input for here_doc. Ensure it ends with a \n

If a test case receives less than 4 arguments without setting LEAKS_ONLY to 0, an error message will be displayed as the subject doesn't clarify how to handle these cases - naturally, your program shouldn't crash.
